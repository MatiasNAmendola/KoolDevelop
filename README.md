----------

#### Namespace based
The framework utilizes PHP namespaces fully, allowing easy inclusion of external libraries. It has an easy to configure AutoLoader for internal files and a PSR-0 compatible autoloader for external dependancies.

#### Model-View-Controller
The framework has a clear usage of the Model-View-Controller pattern helping you to write clean, understandible code. All parts of this pattern are loosly coupled.

#### No tricks
The framework plays no tricks, it helps you where it can, but it doesn't do much without you telling it to. This prevents high loads, bloated applications and unexpected/untraceable problems.

#### Fluent database adaptor
The framework includes a lightweight Fluent database adaptor for SQL databases utilizing prepared statements for speed and security.

#### Pure PHP views
No templating engine that adds yet another layer of obfuscation but pure PHP view files with some powerfull utilties like Elements (reusable mini-views), Helpers (simple to load view libraries) and Placeholders

#### Easy configuration
No large amount of configuration files to edit. Every major part of the framework has it's own .ini file. You only need to configure what you use.
