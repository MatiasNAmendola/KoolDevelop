Use it if you like it but expect things to break. Use at your own risk **\r\n\r\nThe KoolDevelop is a modern, namespaced, object-oriented PHP framework. Altrough\r\nit uses modern grammer it is made to be easy understandible and no-nonsence\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nWant to start a new KoolDevelop powered application? Fork https://github.com/elzekool/KoolDevelopBaseApp\r\n\r\nFor a more complete example take a look at the provided sample application by forking https://github.com/elzekool/KoolDevelopSampleApp\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n#### Namespace based\r\nThe framework utilizes PHP namespaces fully, allowing easy inclusion of external libraries. It has an easy to configure AutoLoader for internal files and a PSR-0 compatible autoloader for external dependancies.\r\n\r\n#### Model-View-Controller\r\nThe framework has a clear usage of the Model-View-Controller pattern helping you to write clean, understandible code. All parts of this pattern are loosly coupled.\r\n\r\n#### No tricks\r\nThe framework plays no tricks, it helps you where it can, but it doesn't do much without you telling it to. This prevents high loads, bloated applications and unexpected/untraceable problems.\r\n\r\n#### Fluent database adaptor\r\nThe framework includes a lightweight Fluent database adaptor for SQL databases utilizing prepared statements for speed and security.\r\n\r\n#### Pure PHP views\r\nNo templating engine that adds yet another layer of obfuscation but pure PHP view files with some powerfull utilties like Elements (reusable mini-views), Helpers (simple to load view libraries) and Placeholders\r\n\r\n#### Easy configuration\r\nNo large amount of configuration files to edit. Every major part of the framework has it's own .ini file. You only need to configure what you use.\r\n","name":"Kooldevelop","google":""}
